# Oshop
# I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my Angular 19 Standalone project! This journey included implementing Authentication, Authorization, a dynamic Product Feed, Shopping Cart, Checkout, Cart Summary, and robust Admin Modules. I also focused on organizing Services, building reusable Components, and performing thorough Code Refactorizations to ensure maintainability.
All of this is powered by Firebase on the backend, making the solution scalable and responsive.
This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to refine my full-stack development skills. I appreciate everyone who supported or provided guidance along the way. I’m looking forward to leveraging these insights on future projects!

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
